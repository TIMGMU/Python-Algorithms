IT-309 is a “bridge” to the more difficult and interesting areas of
the IT field: AI, machine learning, search engines, cryptography which
covers a number of different data structuring techniques and implementation algorithms.

• It’s similar to the medical students learning their individual
specialties beyond basic anatomy

• The fundamental data structures and algorithms that are at the
core of many of these systems are complex and are their own
area of study

Consists of various python programs used as algorithms containing these Data Structures:
– Arrays and sequences
– Stacks and Queues
– Linked Lists
– Trees
– Graphs
→ Algorithm Related
– Searching/Sorting
– Hashing
– Algorithm Analysis
